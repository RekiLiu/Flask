"作词 : STEINMAN, JIM
I know just how to whisper,
and I know just how to cry;
I know just where to find the answers;
and I know just how to lie.
I know just how to fake it,
and I know just how to scheme;
I know just when to face the truth,
and then I know just when to dream.
And I know just where to touch you,
and I know just what to prove;
I know when to pull you closer,
and I know when to let you loose.
And I know the night is fading,
and I know that time's gonna fly;
and I'm never gonna tell you everything
I've got to tell you,
but I know I've got to give it a try.
And I know the roads to riches,
and I know the ways to fame;
I know all the rules
and then I know how to break 'em
and I always know the name of the game.
But I don't know how to leave you,
and I'll never let you fall;
and I don't know how you do it,
making love out of nothing at all
Making love
out of nothing at all,
making love
out of nothing at all,
making love
out of nothing at all,
making love
out of nothing at all,
making love
out of nothing at all
making love
out of nothing at all.
Every time I see you all the rays of the sun
are streaming through the waves in your hair;
and every star in the sky is taking aim
at your eyes like a spotlight,
The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost
and it's looking for a rhythm like you.
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
and turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright.
I've got to follow it, 'cause everything I know,
well it's nothing till I give it to you.
I can make the run or stumble,
I can make the final block;
And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle,
I can make all the stadiums rock.
I can make tonight forever,
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn;
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made,
And I can make all your demons be gone.
But I'm never gonna make it without you,
Do you really want to see me crawl?
And I'm never gonna make it like you do,
Making love out of nothing at all.
Making love
out of nothing at all
making love
out of nothing at all
making love
out of nothing at all
making love
out of nothing at all
making love
out of nothing at all
making love
out of nothing at all
making love"
"Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

So I'll start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

So Sally can wait' she knows its too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away' but don't look back in anger I hear you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock n Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'll gonna start the revolution from my bed
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

So Sally can wait' she knows its too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away' but don't look back in anger I hear you say

So Sally can wait' she knows its too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away' but don't look back in anger I hear you say
So Sally can wait' she knows its too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away' but don't look back in anger I hear you say
At least not today"
"There are places I remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more"
"作曲 : W. Axl Rose & Jeffrey Isbell & Saul Hudson & Michael McKagan
Talk to me softly
There is something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And please don't cry
I know how you feel inside
I've been there before
Somethin' is changin' inside you
And don't you know
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
Give me a whisper
And give me a sign
Give me a kiss before you
Tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinkin' of you
And the times we had...baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight
And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
How I felt inside now honey
You gotta make it your own way
But you'll be alright now sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light now baby
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
Baby maybe someday
Don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry
Tonight"

 作词 : Rose
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time...on your own
Do you need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time...on my own
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
Everybody needs some time...on their own
Don't you know you need some time...all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody ""November Rain"" (Rose)"
"Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt
You're in my heart now
Said, woman, take it slow
It'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow
And we come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
（patience）
Mm, yeah
I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now
I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know, love
There's one more thing to consider
Said, woman, take it slow
And things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes
To make it, We won't fake it,
I'll never break it
'cause I can't take it
...little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah
need a little patience, yeah
just a little patience, yeah
I been walkin' the streets at night
Just tryin' to get it right
Hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like
Being stuck in the crowd
And the streets don't change
But baby the name
I ain't got time for the game
'cause I need you
Yeah, yeah, but I need you
Oo, I need you
Whoa, I need you
Oo, all this time"
"we say good-bye
i turn my back
run away, run away
so predictable
not far from here
you see me crack
like a bone, like a bone
i'm so breakable
and i take everything from you
but you'll take anything
won't you?
run away, run away
like a prodigal
don't you wait for me
don't you wait for me
so ashamed, so ashamed
but i need you so
and you wait for me

i'm on the road
to who knows where?
look ahead, not behind
i keep saying

there's no place to go
where you're not there
on your rope, i hold tight
but it's freeing
and i take everything from you
but you'll take anything
won't you?
run away, run away
like a prodigal
don't you wait for me
don't you wait for me
so ashamed, so ashamed
but i need you so
and you wait for me
and you wait for me

everybody wants to be right
but only if it's not day light?
i keep trying to find my way back
my way back
run away, run away

so ashamed, so ashamed

"Hello world
Hope you're listening
Forgive me if I'm young
For speaking out of turn
There s someone I've been missing
I think that they could be
The better half of me
They're in their own place trying to make it right
But I m tired of justifying
So i say you'll
Come home
Come home
Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long
For so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all i see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home
Oooh
I get lost in the beauty
Of everything i see
The world ain't as half as bad
As they paint it to be
If all the sons
If all the daughters
Stopped to take it in
Well hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin
it might start now
Well maybe I'm just dreaming out loud
until then
Come home
Come home
Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long
For so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all i see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known
ever known
So come home
Everything i can't be
Is everything you should be
And that's why i need you here
Everything i can't be
Is everything you should be
And that's why i need you here
So hear this now
Come home
Come home
Cause I've been waiting for you
For so long
For so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all i see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known
ever known
So come home
Come home"
"There's a fever.

On the highway.

And she's falling.

Man ! I must have been blind !
To carry a torch 4 most of my life.

These days I'm hanging around.

Ur out of my heart.

Get out my town.

"when i first held i was cold
a melting snowman i was told
but there was no one there to hold
before i swore
that i would be alone for ever more
wow look at you now
flowers in the window
it’s such a lovely day
and i’m glad you feel the same
cos to stand up
out in the crowd
you are one in a million
and i love you so
let’s watch the flowers grow
there is no reason to feel bad
but there are many seasons to feel glad sad mad
it’s just a bunch of feelings that we have
to hold
but i am here to help you with the load
it’s such a lovely day
nanana,nanana,nanananana,
so now we’re here and now is fine
so far away from there and there is time time time
to plant new seeds and watch them grow
so there’ll be flowers in the window when we go
wow look at us now
out in the crowd
you are one in a million
oh wow look at you now
and i’m glad you feel the same"
"Everyday in every way I'm falling
Everything that everyone says turns me on/off

Shine a light on me

So that everyone can see

That I wanna stay here indefinitely

Time exists but just on your wrist so don't panic

Moments lasts and lifetimes are lost in a day

So wind your watches down please

'Cos there is no time to lose

And I'm gonna stay here indefinitely

And I wanna stay here so just let me be

Now I can see the light circling round your reflection...

And I'm gonna stay here indefinitely

And I'm gonna stay here so just let me be

Indefinitely, indefinitely, indefinitely

Indefinitely, indefinitely, indefinitely"
"作词 : Healy
Everyday I wake up alone
Because I'm not like all the other boys

And ever since I was young
I had no choice
But it's OK to lead me on
I must admit it's not much fun
To be led on by such a one

As you are
As you are
As you are

And ever since I woke up I felt the net
Was lifting me out of the sea

And even when I'm sinking I feel the need
But it's OK to lead me on
I must admit it's not much fun
To be alone with such a one

As you are
As you are
As you are

And ever since a long time
I felt the rain
And there was no danger
And no more strangers

As you are"

"What's so wrong
Why the face so long
Is it over?
And where you going that
you no longer belong here?
And distance tells you that
distance must come between love
Where have you been, Luv?
When the mistake we made
Was in never having planned to fall in love, Luv
Singing this song
Singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so
In letting you go
It only serves to show me
that I'm still in love with you
Singing this song
Singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so and let you go
It only serves to show me
that I'm still in love with you
So wha's so wrong
Why the face?
So long!
Are you changing?
And where you been to that
you no longer remember?
And distance tells you that
distance must come between love
Where have you been, Luv?

Was in never having planned to fall in love, Luv

Having never ever planned to fall in love, Luv

"See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing to win and
Nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

Nothing wrong, nothing right.

It could bend or it could break

When you feel so tired but you can't sleep

When you love someone but it goes to waste

And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

"作词 : Frey, Henley

she came from providence,
the one in rhode island
where the old world shadows hang
heavy in the air
she packed her hopes and dreams
like a refugee
just as her father came across the sea
she heard about a place people were simlin
they spoke about the red mans way,
and how they loved the land
and they came from everywhere
to the great divide
seeking a place to stand
or a place to hide
down in the crowded bars,
out for a good time,
cant wait to tell you all,
what its like up there
and they called it paradise
i dont know why
somebody laid the mountains low
while the town got high
then the chilly winds blew down
across the desert
through the canyons of the coast,
to the malibu
where the pretty people play,
hungry for power
to light their neon way
and give them things to do
some rich men came and raped the land,
nobody caught em
put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and jesus,
people bought em
and they called it paradise
the place to be
they watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea

you can leave it all behind
and sail to lahaina
just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
they even brought a neon sign:""jesus is coming""
brought the white mans burden down
brought the white mans reign
who will provide the grand design?
what is yours and what is mine?
cause there is no more new frontier
we have got to make it here
we satifsy our endless needs
and justify our bloody deeds,
in the name of destiny
and the name of god
and you can see them there,
on sunday morning
stand up and sing about
what its like up there
they call it paradise
i dont know why
you call someplace paradise,
kiss it goodbye"
"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow
Don' you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no youger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're loosin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you, before it's too late"
"Tonight the sky above
Reminds me of you, love
Walking through wintertime
Where the stars all shine

The angel on the stairs
Will tell you I was there
Under the front porch light
On a mystery night

I've been sitting watching life
pass from the sidelines
Been waiting for a dream
to seep in through my blinds
I wondered what might happen
if I left this all behind
Would the wind be at my back ?
Could I get you off my mind
This time

The neon lights in bars
And headlights from the cars
Have started a symphony
Inside of me
The things I left behind
Have melted in my mind
And now there's a purity
Inside of me

I've been sitting watching life
pass from the sidelines
Been waiting for a dream
to seep in through my blinds
I wondered what might happen
if I left this all behind
Would the wind be at my back ?
Could I get you off my mind
This time

I've been sitting watching life
pass from the sidelines
Been waiting for a dream
to seep in through my blinds
I wondered what might happen
if I left this all behind
Would the wind be at my back ?
Could I get you off my mind
This time"
"That coat that I gave you
All shiny and black
I'm sorry my darling
But I'm taking it back
I don't want to spoil the party
But I've got to go home
You can stay if you want to
If you want to sleep alone
Some are born to greatness
Some are born to die
Never knowing the difference
Never knowing why
Some are born to change the world
Some never even try
But darling, you and I:
We were born to cry
Black has become your favourite colour
For of all the things it can conceal
And as we lie here together
I know exactly how you feel
It's time for me to leave this party
But I've just got to ask you first
If you're only trying to make things better
How come they always turn out worse?
Some are born to greatness
Some are born to die
Never knowing the difference
Never knowing why
Some are born to change the world
Some never even try
But darling, you and I:
We were born to cry

Oh, some are born to greatness
And some are born to die
And never knowing the difference
And never knowing why
Some are born to change the world
Some never even try
But darling, you and I:
We were born to cry
Yes darling, you and I:
Oh, we were born to cry
Born to cry"
